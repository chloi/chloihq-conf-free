Deployment at Mozilla YVR
=============

*This will only apply for folks that have Mozilla LDAP accounts*

To deploy to the Mozilla PaaS, you will first need to be a member of the YVR group. If you're not, feel free to ping cturra for access.
With access (and the stackato client), run the following commands to login and join the group:

```
  stackato target api.paas.allizom.org
  stackato login <email>
  stackato group yvr
```

From this point, you can deploy normally :)
